(More or less) direct rust implementation of the SS-tree (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/492202) described in the 'Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures' Manning book (https://www.manning.com/books/advanced-algorithms-and-data-structures).

SS-Trees support similarity queries in multi dimensional data sets and stay balanced under incremental updates, similar to R-Trees, but are simpler to implement and potentially offer better performance for higher dimension counts. Tree nodes and payloads are stored as position/radius pairs ("circles" or "spheres" in plain english) rather than axis-aligned bounding boxes. Although they seem to be mainly targeting high dimensional feature vectors in image processing, they work well in this 3D usecase (and I did not fancy implementing an R-Tree...)
